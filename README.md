## Key Features

* Responsive Design: Our e-commerce app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that the user experience is optimal on both desktop and mobile devices.
* Product Listing and Filtering: Users can browse through a wide range of products, filter them by category, price range, and more.
* Product Detail Page: Each product has a dedicated page that provides detailed information such as images, description, and reviews.
* Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their shopping cart and view the total cost of their purchase.
* Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout, enter their shipping and billing information, and select their preferred payment method.

## How To Use

A live version of the web app is available [Here](https://kanban-board-management.vercel.app)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/zippo212/kanban-board.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```
* Start the development server by running `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will start the server at http://localhost:3000 and will automatically reload the page as you make changes to the code.
* To build the production version of the app, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. This will create a build folder in the root of the project, which you can then serve using a static server.
